# Inference Diabetes Diagnosis Using NaÃ¯ve Bayes
This is a solution to the diabetes dataset using Naive Bayes. The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, and then the data is fit into the Naive Bayes model. The model is then used to predict on the testing set, and the results are displayed.
